# Consent Management Platform TCFv2 Stub

This package provides a TCFv2 CMP Stub in Typescript.

The stub is a slightly modified version published by IAB, adapted to TypeScript,
and is intended to be used in larger software projects which need to load an cmp.

For more details see [Transparency and Consent Framework](https://github.com/InteractiveAdvertisingBureau/GDPR-Transparency-and-Consent-Framework).

## Installation / Use in TypeScript projects

```bash
npm install @mdnx/tcf-stub --save
```
